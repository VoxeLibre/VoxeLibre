The achievement "Burger Time!" is an homage to the classic coin-op arcade game BurgerTime, by Data East (1982) and
Bally Midway.

Information about the BurgerTime Arcade Game:

From https://thepinballgameroom.com/product/burgertime-arcade-machine/ on the original game:
BurgerTime Arcade Machine, originally released as Hamburger in Japan, is a 1982 arcade game developed by Data East
initially for its DECO Cassette System.  In the United States, Data East USA licensed BurgerTime Arcade Machine for
distribution by Bally Midway as a standard dedicated arcade game. Data East also released its own version of BurgerTime
in the United States through its DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the
manufacturer’s name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artworks, as the game itself is identical.
