Stairs are useful to reach higher places by walking over them; jumping is not required. Placing stairs in a corner pattern will create corner stairs. Stairs placed on the ceiling or at the upper half of the side of a block will be placed upside down.=

Slabs are half as high as their full block counterparts and occupy either the lower or upper part of a block, depending on how it was placed. Slabs can be easily stepped on without needing to jump. When a slab is placed on another slab of the same type, a double slab is created.=
Upper @1=
Double slabs are full blocks which are created by placing two slabs of the same kind on each other.=
