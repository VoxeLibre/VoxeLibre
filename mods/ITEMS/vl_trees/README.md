# VoxeLibre Trees API

This mod provides APIs to register trees. Actual tree registration happens in
other mods, like `mcl_core`.

See `API.md` for reference.


**Special thanks to:**

* Wuzzy, for being the one behind most of the root work making MTG's `default`
  actually have some nice-looking trees.
* cora, for making the `mcl_trees` mod, which served as a reference and an
  example for this. Some code also comes from it and is attributed in comments.
* ryvnf, for completely rewriting the leafdecay logic into something both much
  more performant and reliable, amongst other contributions to `mcl_trees`.
* kno10 and JoseDouglas26 for the simplified 2x2 sapling check code, also
  attributed in comments.
* ...and many others who contributed to VoxeLibre's `mcl_core` and Mineclonia's
  `mcl_trees` over the years. Their names are forever remembered in the commit
  history.
