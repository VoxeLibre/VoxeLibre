Composter=
Composters can convert various organic items into bonemeal.=
Use organic items on the composter to fill it with layers of compost. Every time an item is put in the composter, there is a chance that the composter adds another layer of compost.  Some items have a bigger chance of adding an extra layer than other items.  After filling up with 7 layers of compost, the composter is full and bone meal can be retrieved from it. Taking out the bone meal empties the composter.=
