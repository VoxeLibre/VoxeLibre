--USING the mod--
------------------

This mod inplements to new functions to the players inventory. The first is the breaking sound of any tool,
that is played when a tool breakes after the specific number of uses.

The second new function is Auto-refill. This function replaces broken tools or emptied stacks with others from your inventory.


You can disable the auto-refill by changing first line of init.lua to "local auto_refill = false"
