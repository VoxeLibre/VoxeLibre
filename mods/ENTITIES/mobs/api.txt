MOB API

The mob api is a function that can be called on by other mods to add new animals or monsters into minetest.

    minetest.conf settings*

    'enable_damage' if true monsters will attack players (default is true)
    'only_peaceful_mobs' if true only animals will spawn in game (default is false)
    'mobs_disable_blood' if false blood effects appear when mob is hit (default is false)
    'mobs_spawn_protected' if set to false then mobs will not spawn in protected areas (default is true)
    'remove_far_mobs' if true then mobs that are outside players visual range will be removed (default is false)
    'mobname' can change specific mob chance rate (0 to disable) and spawn number e.g. mobs_animal:cow = 1000,5
    'mob_difficulty' sets difficulty level (health and hit damage multiplied by this number), defaults to 1.0.
    'mob_show_health' if false then punching mob will not show health status (true by default)
    'mob_chance_multiplier' multiplies chance of all mobs spawning and can be set to 0.5 to have mobs spawn more or 2.0 to spawn less. e.g.  1 in 7000 * 0.5 = 1 in 3500 so better odds of spawning.

Custom mob functions inside mob registry:

        'on_die' a function that is called when the mob is killed the parameters are (self, pos)
        'on_rightclick' its same as in minetest.register_entity()
        'on_blast' is called when an explosion happens near mob when using TNT functions, parameters are (object, damage) and returns (do_damage, do_knockback, drops)
        'on_spawn' is a custom function that runs on mob spawn with 'self' as variable, return true at end of function to run only once.
        'after_activate' is a custom function that runs once mob has been activated with the paramaters (self, staticdata, def, dtime)
        'on_breed' called when two similar mobs breed, paramaters are (parent1, parent2) objects, return false to stop child from being resized and owner/tamed flags and child textures being applied.
        'on_grown' is called when a child mob has grown up, only paramater is (self).
        'do_punch' called when mob is punched with paramaters (self, hitter, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction), return false to stop punch damage and knockback from taking place.



Mobs can look for specific nodes as they walk and replace them to mimic eating.

        'replace_what' group if items to replace e.g. {"farming:wheat_8", "farming:carrot_8"}
        'replace_with' replace with what e.g. "air" or in chickens case "mobs:egg"
        'replace_rate' how random should the replace rate be (typically 10)
        'replace_offset' +/- value to check specific node to replace
       	'on_replace(self, pos, oldnode, newnode)' gets called when mob is about to replace a node
	    self: ObjectRef of mob
	    pos: Position of node to replace
	    oldnode: Current node
	    newnode: What the node will become after replacing

	    If false is returned, the mob will not replace the node.

	    By default, replacing sets self.gotten to true and resets the object properties.

The 'replace_what' has been updated to use tables for what, with and y_offset e.g.

   replace_what = { {"group:grass", "air", 0}, {"default:dirt_with_grass", "default:dirt", -1} }

Mob animation comes in three parts, start_frame, end_frame and frame_speed which
can be added to the mob definition under pre-defined mob animation names like:

   'animation' a table with the animation ranges and speed of the model
      'stand_start', 'stand_end', 'stand_speed' when mob stands still
      'walk_start', 'walk_end', 'walk_speed' when mob walks
      'run_start', 'run_end', 'run_speed' when mob runs
      'fly_start', 'fly_end', 'fly_speed' when mob flies
      'punch_start', 'punch_end', 'punch_speed' when mob attacks
      'punch2_start', 'punch2_end', 'punch2_speed' when mob attacks (alternative)
      'shoot_start', 'shoot_end', shoot_speed' when mob shoots
      'die_start', 'die_end', 'die_speed' when mob dies
      '*_loop' bool value to determine if any set animation loops e.g (die_loop = false)
      defaults to true if not set
also  'speed_normal' for compatibility with older mobs for animation speed (deprecated)


The mob api also has some preset variables and functions that it will remember for each mob

    'self.health' contains current health of mob (cannot exceed self.hp_max)
    'self.texture_list' contains list of all mob textures
    'self.child_texture' contains mob child texture when growing up
    'self.base_texture' contains current skin texture which was randomly selected from textures list
    'self.gotten' this is used for obtaining milk from cow and wool from sheep
    'self.horny' when animal fed enough it is set to true and animal can breed with same animal
    'self.hornytimer' background timer that controls breeding functions and mob childhood timings
    'self.child' used for when breeding animals have child, will use child_texture and be half size
    'self.owner' string used to set owner of npc mobs, typically used for dogs
    'self.order' set to "follow" or "stand" so that npc will follow owner or stand it's ground
    'self.nametag' contains the name of the mob which it can show above
    'on_die' a function that is called when mob is killed
    'do_custom' a custom function that is called every tick while mob is active and which has access to all of the self.* variables e.g. (self.health for health or self.standing_in for node status), return with 'false' to skip remainder of mob API.


mobs:register_spawn(name, nodes, max_light, min_light, chance, active_object_count, max_height, day_toggle)

mobs:spawn_specfic(name, nodes, neighbors, min_light, max_light, interval, chance, active_object_count, min_height, max_height, day_toggle, on_spawn)

These functions register a spawn algorithm for the mob. Without this function the call the mobs won't spawn.

    'name' is the name of the animal/monster
    'nodes' is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster can spawn on top of
    'neighbors' is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster will spawn beside (default is {"air"} for mobs:register_spawn)
    'max_light' is the maximum of light
    'min_light' is the minimum of light
    'interval' is same as in register_abm() (default is 30 for mobs:register_spawn)
    'chance' is same as in register_abm()
    'active_object_count' mob is only spawned if active_object_count_wider of ABM is <= this
    'min_height' is the minimum height the mob can spawn
    'max_height' is the maximum height the mob can spawn
    'day_toggle' true for day spawning, false for night or nil for anytime
    'on_spawn' is a custom function which runs after mob has spawned and gives self and pos values.

... also a simpler way to handle mob spawns has been added with the mobs:spawn(def) command which uses above names to make settings clearer:

    mobs:spawn({name = "mobs_monster:tree_monster",
       nodes = {"group:leaves"},
       max_light = 7,
    })


Players can override the spawn chance for each mob registered by adding a line to their minetest.conf file with a new value, the lower the value the more each mob will spawn e.g.

mobs_animal:sheep_chance 11000 or mobs_monster:sand_monster_chance 100

For each mob that spawns with this function is a field in mobs.spawning_mobs. It tells if the mob should spawn or not. Default is true. So other mods can only use the API of this mod by disabling the spawning of the default mobs in this mod.


mobs:register_arrow(name, definition)

This function registers a arrow for mobs with the attack type shoot.

    'name' is the name of the arrow
    -definition' is a table with the following values:

            the parameters are (self, player)
        'hit_mob' a function that is called when the arrow hits a mob; this function should hurt the mob
            the parameters are (self, player)
        'hit_node' a function that is called when the arrow hits a node
            the parameters are (self, pos, node)
        'tail' when set to 1 adds a trail or tail to mob arrows
        'tail_texture' texture string used for above effect
        'tail_size' has size for above texture (defaults to between 5 and 10)
        'expire' contains float value for how long tail appears for (defaults to 0.25)
        'glow' has value for how brightly tail glows 1 to 10 (default is 0, no glow)
        'rotate' integer value in degrees to rotate arrow
    'on_step' is a custom function when arrow is active, nil for default.


mobs:register_egg(name, description, background, addegg, no_creative)

    'self' mob information
    'clicker' player information
    'chance_hand' chance of capturing mob by hand (1 to 100) 0 to disable
