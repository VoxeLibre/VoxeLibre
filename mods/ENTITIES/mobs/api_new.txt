Mobs Redo API
=============

Welcome to the world of mobs in minetest and hopefully an easy guide to defining
your own mobs and having them appear in your worlds.


Registering Mobs
----------------

To register a mob and have it ready for use requires the following function:

   mobs:register_mob(name, definition)

The 'name' of a mob usually starts with the mod name it's running from followed
by it's own name e.g.

   "mobs_monster:sand_monster" or "mymod:totally_awesome_beast"

... and the 'definition' is a table which holds all of the settings and
functions needed for the mob to work properly which contains the following:

   'nametag'       contains the name which is shown above mob.
   'type'          holds the type of mob that inhabits your world e.g.
      "animal"     usually docile and walking around.
      "monster"    attacks player or npc on sight.
      "npc"        walk around and will defend themselves if hit first, they
                   kill monsters.
   'hp_min'        has the minimum health value the mob can spawn with.
   'hp_max'        has the maximum health value the mob can spawn with.
   'armor'         holds strength of mob, 100 is normal, lower is more powerful
                   and needs more hits and better weapons to kill.
   'passive'       when true allows animals to defend themselves when hit,
                   otherwise they amble onwards.
   'walk_velocity' is the speed that your mob can walk around.
   'run_velocity'  is the speed your mob can run with, usually when attacking.
   'walk_chance'   has a 0-100 chance value your mob will walk from standing,
                   set to 0 for jumping mobs only.
   'jump'          when true allows your mob to jump updwards.
   'jump_height'   holds the height your mob can jump, 0 to disable jumping.
   'step_height'   height of a block that your mob can easily walk up onto.
   'fly'           when true allows your mob to fly around instead of walking.
   'fly_in'        holds the node name that the mob flies (or swims) around
                   in e.g. "air" or "default:water_source".
   'runaway'       if true causes animals to turn and run away when hit.
   'view_range'    how many nodes in distance the mob can see a player.
   'reach'         how many nodes in distance a mob can attack a player while
                   standing.
   'damage'        how many health points the mob does to a player or another
                   mob when melee attacking.
   'knockback'     when true has mobs falling backwards when hit, the greater
                   the damage the more they move back.
   'fear_height'   is how high a cliff or edge has to be before the mob stops
                   walking, 0 to turn off height fear.
   'fall_speed'    has the maximum speed the mob can fall at, default is -10.
   'fall_damage'   when true causes falling to inflict damage.
   'water_damage'  holds the damage per second infliced to mobs when standing in
                   water.
   'lava_damage'   holds the damage per second inflicted to mobs when standing
                   in lava or fire.
   'light_damage'  holds the damage per second inflicted to mobs when it's too
                   bright (above 13 light).
   'suffocation'   when true causes mobs to suffocate inside solid blocks.
   'floats'        when set to 1 mob will float in water, 0 has them sink.
   'follow'        mobs follow player when holding any of the items which appear
                   on this table, the same items can be fed to a mob to tame or
                   breed e.g. {"farming:wheat", "default:apple"}

   'reach'               is how far the mob can attack player when standing
                         nearby, default is 3 nodes.
   'docile_by_day'       when true has mobs wandering around during daylight

   'selection_box'     has the box in which player can interact with mob
   'textures'          holds a table list of textures to be used for mob, or you
                       could use multiple lists inside another table for random

   'double_melee_attack' when true has the api choose between 'punch' and
                      'punch2' animations.

   'animation'       holds a table containing animation names and settings for use with mesh models:
      'stand_start'  start frame for when mob stands still.
      'stand_end'    end frame of stand animation.
      'stand_speed'  speed of animation in frames per second.
      'walk_start'   when mob is walking around.
      'walk_end'
      'walk_speed'
      'run_start'    when a mob runs or attacks.

      looping.

      'speed_normal' is used for animation speed for compatibility with some
                     older mobs.


Node Replacement
----------------

Mobs can look around for specific nodes as they walk and replace them to mimic
eating.

   'replace_what'   group of items to replace e.g.
                    {"farming:wheat_8", "farming:carrot_8"}
                    or you can use the specific options of what, with and
                    y offset by using this instead:
                    {
                       {"group:grass", "air", 0},
                       {"default:dirt_with_grass", "default:dirt", -1}
                    }
   'replace_with'   replace with what e.g. "air" or in chickens case "mobs:egg"
   'replace_rate'   how random should the replace rate be (typically 10)
   'replace_offset' +/- value to check specific node to replace

   'on_replace(self, pos, oldnode, newnode)' is called when mob is about to
                                             replace a node.
      'self'    ObjectRef of mob
      'pos'     Position of node to replace
      'oldnode' Current node
      'newnode' What the node will become after replacing

       If false is returned, the mob will not replace the node.

       By default, replacing sets self.gotten to true and resets the object
       properties.


Custom Definition Functions
---------------------------

Along with the above mob registry settings we can also use custom functions to
enhance mob functionality and have them do many interesting things:

   'on_die'         a function that is called when the mob is killed the
                    parameters are (self, pos)
   'on_rightclick'  its same as in minetest.register_entity()
   'on_blast'       is called when an explosion happens near mob when using TNT
                    functions, parameters are (object, damage) and returns
                    (do_damage, do_knockback, drops)
   'on_spawn'       is a custom function that runs on mob spawn with 'self' as
                    variable, return true at end of function to run only once.
   'after_activate' is a custom function that runs once mob has been activated
                    with these paramaters (self, staticdata, def, dtime)
   'on_breed'       called when two similar mobs breed, paramaters are
                    (parent1, parent2) objects, return false to stop child from
                    being resized and owner/tamed flags and child textures being
                    applied.  Function itself must spawn new child mob.
   'on_grown'       is called when a child mob has grown up, only paramater is
                    (self).
   'do_punch'       called when mob is punched with paramaters (self, hitter,
                    time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction), return
                    false to stop punch damage and knockback from taking place.
   'custom_attack'  when set this function is called instead of the normal mob
                    melee attack, parameters are (self, to_attack).
   'on_die'         a function that is called when mob is killed
   'do_custom'      a custom function that is called every tick while mob is
                    active and which has access to all of the self.* variables
                    e.g. (self.health for health or self.standing_in for node
                    status), return with 'false' to skip remainder of mob API.


Internal Variables
------------------

The mob api also has some preset variables and functions that it will remember
for each mob.

   'self.health'        contains current health of mob (cannot exceed
                        self.hp_max)
   'self.texture_list'  contains list of all mob textures
   'self.child_texture' contains mob child texture when growing up
   'self.base_texture'  contains current skin texture which was randomly
                        selected from textures list
   'self.gotten'        this is used for obtaining milk from cow and wool from
                        sheep
   'self.horny'         when animal fed enough it is set to true and animal can
                        breed with same animal
   'self.hornytimer'    background timer that controls breeding functions and
                        mob childhood timings
   'self.child'         used for when breeding animals have child, will use
                        child_texture and be half size
   'self.owner'         string used to set owner of npc mobs, typically used for
                        dogs
   'self.order'         set to "follow" or "stand" so that npc will follow owner
                        or stand it's ground
   'self.nametag'       contains the name of the mob which it can show above


Spawning Mobs in World
----------------------

mobs:register_spawn(name, nodes, max_light, min_light, chance,
   active_object_count, max_height, day_toggle)

mobs:spawn_specfic(name, nodes, neighbors, min_light, max_light, interval,
   chance, active_object_count, min_height, max_height, day_toggle, on_spawn)

These functions register a spawn algorithm for the mob. Without this function
the call the mobs won't spawn.

    'name'                is the name of the animal/monster
    'nodes'               is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster can
                          spawn on top of
    'neighbors'           is a list of nodenames on that the animal/monster will
                          spawn beside (default is {"air"} for
                          mobs:register_spawn)
    'max_light'           is the maximum of light
    'min_light'           is the minimum of light
    'interval'            is same as in register_abm() (default is 30 for
                          mobs:register_spawn)
    'chance'              is same as in register_abm()
    'active_object_count' number of this type of mob to spawn at one time inside
                          map area
    'min_height'          is the minimum height the mob can spawn
    'max_height'          is the maximum height the mob can spawn
    'day_toggle'          true for day spawning, false for night or nil for
                          anytime
    'on_spawn'            is a custom function which runs after mob has spawned
                          and gives self and pos values.

A simpler way to handle mob spawns has been added with the mobs:spawn(def)
command which uses above names to make settings clearer:

    mobs:spawn({name = "mobs_monster:tree_monster",
       nodes = {"group:leaves"},
       max_light = 7,
    })


For each mob that spawns with this function is a field in mobs.spawning_mobs.
It tells if the mob should spawn or not.  Default is true.  So other mods can
only use the API of this mod by disabling the spawning of the default mobs in
this mod.


Making Arrows
-------------

mobs:register_arrow(name, definition)

This function registers a arrow for mobs with the attack type shoot.

    'name'            is the name of the arrow
    'definition'      is a table with the following values:
       'visual'       same is in minetest.register_entity()
       'visual_size'  same is in minetest.register_entity()
       'textures'     same is in minetest.register_entity()
       'velocity'     the velocity of the arrow
       'drop'         if set to true any arrows hitting a node will drop as item
       'hit_player'   a function that is called when the arrow hits a player;
                      this function should hurt the player, the parameters are
                      (self, player)
       'hit_mob'      a function that is called when the arrow hits a mob;
                      this function should hurt the mob, the parameters are
                      (self, player)
       'hit_node'     a function that is called when the arrow hits a node, the
                      parameters are (self, pos, node)
       'tail'         when set to 1 adds a trail or tail to mob arrows
       'tail_texture' texture string used for above effect
       'tail_size'    has size for above texture (defaults to between 5 and 10)
       'expire'       contains float value for how long tail appears for
                      (defaults to 0.25)
       'glow'         has value for how brightly tail glows 1 to 10 (default is
                      0 for no glow)
       'rotate'       integer value in degrees to rotate arrow
       'on_step'      is a custom function when arrow is active, nil for
                      default.


Spawn Eggs
----------

mobs:register_egg(name, description, background, addegg, no_creative)

This function registers a spawn egg which can be used by admin to properly spawn in a mob.

   'name'        this is the name of your new mob to spawn e.g. "mob:sheep"
   'description' the name of the new egg you are creating e.g. "Spawn Sheep"
   'background'  the texture displayed for the egg in inventory
   'addegg'      would you like an egg image in front of your texture (1 = yes,
                 0 = no)
   'no_creative' when set to true this stops spawn egg appearing in creative
                 mode for destructive mobs like Dungeon Masters.


Explosion Function
------------------

mobs:explosion(pos, radius) -- DEPRECATED!!!  use mobs:boom() instead

mobs:boom(self, pos, radius)
   'self' mob entity
   'pos' centre position of explosion
   'radius' radius of explosion (typically set to 3)

This function generates an explosion which removes nodes in a specific radius
and damages any entity caught inside the blast radius.  Protection will limit
node destruction but not entity damage.

   'self.driver_eye_offset' position offset for attached player view
   'self.driver_scale'      sets driver scale for mobs larger than {x=1, y=1}


External Settings for "minetest.conf"
------------------------------------

   'enable_damage'          if true monsters will attack players (default is true)
   'only_peaceful_mobs'     if true only animals will spawn in game (default is
                            false)
   'mobs_disable_blood'     if false blood effects appear when mob is hit (default
                            is false)
   'mobs_spawn_protected'   if set to false then mobs will not spawn in protected
                            areas (default is true)
   'remove_far_mobs'        if true then mobs that are outside players visual
                            range will be removed (default is false)
   'mobname'                can change specific mob chance rate (0 to disable) and
                            spawn number e.g. mobs_animal:cow = 1000,5
   'mob_difficulty'         sets difficulty level (health and hit damage
                            multiplied by this number), defaults to 1.0.
   'mob_show_health'        if false then punching mob will not show health status
                            (true by default)
   'mob_chance_multiplier'  multiplies chance of all mobs spawning and can be set
                            to 0.5 to have mobs spawn more or 2.0 to spawn less.
                            e.g.  1 in 7000 * 0.5 = 1 in 3500 so better odds of
                            spawning.

Players can override the spawn chance for each mob registered by adding a line
to their minetest.conf file with a new value, the lower the value the more each
mob will spawn e.g.

mobs_animal:sheep_chance 11000
mobs_monster:sand_monster_chance 100
