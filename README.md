VoxeLibre is a survival sandbox game for Luanti. Survive, gather, hunt, mine for ores,
build, explore, and do much more. Inspired by Minecraft, pushing beyond.

Originally forked from MineClone (by davedevils) as MineClone 2, then renamed
and heavily improved. Developed by many people, see
[`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md) for a complete list.


## About

You start in a randomly generated world made entirely of cubes. You can explore
the world, dig, and build using almost every available block to create new
structures. You can choose to play in **survival mode**, in which you must fight
monsters and stave off hunger while slowly progressing through various aspects
of the game—such as mining, farming, and building machines. Alternatively, you
can opt for **creative mode**, where you can do anything you can imagine with a
snap of your fingers.

See [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md) for a quick guide on how to start
playing VoxeLibre.

## Status

VoxeLibre is currently in the **beta** stage. It is fully playable, but not yet
feature-complete, and you may encounter bugs while playing. Backwards
compatibility is not entirely guaranteed, and upgrading your world might cause
small bugs. If you want to, you can use the development version (the `master`
Git branch) to get the newest content and help us catch bugs before release.

### Goals

* Create a stable, peformant, moddable and fun free & open-source game, making
  the most out of the Luanti engine, playable both in single- and multiplayer
* Expand and improve upon the gameplay that many players are familiar with,
  adding unique features and polishing the existing ones along the way
* Work on the tasks outlined in the [Milestones](/VoxeLibre/VoxeLibre/milestones)
  and themed [Projects](/VoxeLibre/VoxeLibre/projects) to make the game better
* Ensure proper localization support, enabling translations in as many languages
  as possible
* [Maintain a friendly and inclusive community of players and developers](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
